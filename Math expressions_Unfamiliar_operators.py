# Type the modulo operator

1 % 6 

# What is the name of this operator (one word, lowercase)?

# %

# modulou

# Write the code that finds the remainder when 8 is divided by 3.

# Find the remainder when you divide 12 by 3. Assign the result to the variable left_over.

# left_over = 12 % 3 
# print(left_over)

# total = total + 5

# Code the shorthand version of the following statement:

# loss = loss - 5

loss -= 5

# Find the remainder when you divide one number by another and assign the result to a variable. Make up the numbers and the variable name.

# Use shorthand code to multiply a variable by a number and assign the result to the same variable. Make up the variable name and the number.

# Find what's left over when you divide one variable by another and assign the result to a third variable. Make up the variable names.

# Using shorthand code, subtract one variable from another and assign the result to the first variable. Make up the variable names.

# In a single line of code, display the remainder—that is, what's left over—when 100 is divided by 11.

# Type the modulo operator

1 % 6 

# What is the name of this operator (one word, lowercase)?

# %

# modulou

# Write the code that finds the remainder when 8 is divided by 3.

num = 8 % 3

# Find the remainder when you divide 12 by 3. Assign the result to the variable left_over.

# left_over = 12 % 3 
# print(left_over)

# total = total + 5

total += 5

# Code the shorthand version of the following statement:

# loss = loss - 5

loss -= 5

# Find the remainder when you divide one number by another and assign the result to a variable. Make up the numbers and the variable name.

number_one = 100 % 25
remander_one = number_one
print(remander_one)

Use shorthand code to multiply a variable by a number and assign the result to the same variable. Make up the variable name and the number.
